# Steams Assignment

Author: Sean Kennedy
Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/ocp11_from_oca8/

These exercises are based on question id’s (QID’s) from [Enthuware](https://enthuware.com/), the excellent Java Certification 
training tool. [Enthuware](https://enthuware.com/) is an MCQ tool and this is why some answers in the video refer to “options”.
However, I have left these discussions in the solutions video as it enables me to discuss extra material,
which aids in the learning experience. Note: the QID’s are from Java 8 OCP question bank.
